    <p>Learning about the history of Javascript, I came in not knowing what to expect but came out full of realizations 
        and appreciation for the language. This language originally started as a project that was proposed to Netscape as a 
        language to use for their own browser. I did not know that Javascript was only initially targeted for a single browser’s 
        use which is quite shocking how quickly this technology grew into its current state. The fight for its support for other 
        web browsers, especially for Microsoft’s browser, was really intriguing. It made me realize the work that it takes to 
        standardize a single idea for everyone’s ease of use. The story of the name is also quite interesting to me because it 
        was stated that the name, which was supposed to be Livescript on beta, was changed to JavaScript to attract the growing 
        population of Java Developers and give them a sense of home. What piqued my interest can be laid to two things; their 
        marketing strategy and how it remains to be true today. Firstly, it is quite smart to take advantage of something that 
        is already popular. It is akin to “free advertisement” and one may argue that this is a dirty tactic but for me, this 
        is smart. Second, I really appreciate this strategy because of how it propagates to this day. When I initially didn’t 
        have an idea what JavaScript was, when asking about it, I always ask if it has a relationship with Java. And learning 
        about it, I don’t feel pressure or struggles because in the back of my mind, since I know Java, JavaScript should be 
        easy-peasy. It really gives me this sort of “placebo effect”, if I could describe it. It gives me a sense of home. </p>

    <p>Although it wasn’t always sunshine and butterflies for JavaScript especially when 2000 came and ECMAScript, the standardization 
        that supports the script across multiple browsers, stopped its support for the language for Internet Explorer. 
        This made me think that even when things are on their high, there could always be unforeseen circumstances that could 
        turn things around. But even so, we should always push forward. That’s what JavaScript did and as ECMAScript brought 
        back their support for it, many fruits were reaped. JavaScript was used to create multiple revolutionary development 
        techs such as AJAX, Prototype, Dojo, and one of the most popular of them all, JQuery. And as JavaScript grew more and 
        more, on 2009 onwards, JavaScript became the “Language of the Web” wherein it supported not only browser-side coding, 
        but also server-side. Overtime, JavaScript was not only used for backend anymore but it also propagated into frontend, 
        browser, serverside, and even IoT devices among many more!</p>
        
    <p>With all of these realizations, I came to conclude that practicality and support for everyone is the main goal of the community. 
        This story emphasizes the marvels that practicality can bring into our lives. I appreciate how the growth of this technology 
        was made more adamant because of the will of developers to support other developers. It gives me this sense of camaraderie. 
        To the man who initially developed JavaScript, it must be such a proud moment for him to see his child grow to what it is today.</p>
